# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root: the glossary. It is a glossary and nothing else — no implementation detail lives there.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read the ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-build-on-the-fuse-source.md
│       └── 0002-hand-write-the-api-client.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

Three terms in this repo deliberately differ from the names the Pitaka API uses — `Schedule`, `Profile`, and `generated transaction`. The translation happens at the HTTP adapter and nowhere above it, so API names such as `RecurringTransaction` are correct inside the adapter and wrong everywhere else. See ADR 0003.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_

One ADR here is expected to be contradicted eventually: ADR 0004 (the 60-minute session) records a workaround with a planned death date. When refresh tokens land in the API, that ADR is superseded rather than reopened.
